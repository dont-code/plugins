<h2>What am I seeing ?</h2>
<p>You have opened the Preview App. The Preview App connects to Online services to receive Application changes from the Application Builder in realtime.</p>
<p><b>Check you are connected</b> to the online service by looking at the <kor-icon icon="sync"></kor-icon> icon in the header panel.</p>
<p><kor-icon icon="sync"></kor-icon> means you are ok, <kor-icon color="rgb(var(--functional-red))" icon="sync_problem"></kor-icon> you have connection issue to the online service. Please check the browser log in this case</p>
<p>If <kor-icon icon="sync"></kor-icon>, then <b>go back to the Application Builder</b> and enter some values in the Editor</p>
